# Deployment Issues Fixed

## Issues Resolved

### 1. MIME Type Error for JSX Files
**Error**: `Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/jsx"`

**Fix**: 
- Added `assetsInclude: ['**/*.jsx']` to vite.config.js
- Added `esbuild` configuration for proper JSX handling
- Updated netlify.toml with proper MIME type headers

### 2. Font Preloading Issues
**Error**: `The resource https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins... was preloaded using link preload but not used within a few seconds`

**Fix**: 
- Changed from preload with onload to direct stylesheet loading
- Removed async font loading to prevent preload warnings
- Updated both Poppins and Font Awesome loading

### 3. Service Worker Font Caching Failures
**Error**: `[SW] Font request failed: TypeError: Failed to fetch`

**Fix**: 
- Added proper CORS handling for font requests
- Changed error response from 404 to 200 with CSS content type
- Added credentials: 'omit' for font requests

### 4. Missing Element.closest() Method
**Error**: `Uncaught TypeError: e.target.closest is not a function`

**Fix**: 
- Added polyfill for Element.closest() method
- Added polyfill for Element.matches() method
- Ensures compatibility with older browsers

## Files Modified

1. **vite.config.js**
   - Added assetsInclude for JSX files
   - Added esbuild configuration

2. **index.html**
   - Changed font loading from preload to direct loading
   - Added polyfills for Element.closest() and Element.matches()

3. **public/sw.js**
   - Fixed font request handling with proper CORS
   - Improved error responses for failed font requests

4. **netlify.toml**
   - Already had proper MIME type headers (no changes needed)

## Testing

After these fixes, the following should be resolved:
- ✅ No more MIME type errors for JSX files
- ✅ No more font preload warnings
- ✅ Service worker font caching works properly
- ✅ Element.closest() method available in all browsers

## Deployment Commands

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview  # Test locally before deploying
```

The app should now deploy without console errors and work properly across all browsers.
